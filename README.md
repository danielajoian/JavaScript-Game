# Memory Game

It's a game where you can test your visual memory by flipping two cards at a time.

You have to remember where were the two identical cards on the board and flip the toghether, if they match they stay with the front side up, if they don't, they flip back.


You can choose the size of the board and in the same time you choose the number of pair cards, this way you choose the difficulty of the game.
